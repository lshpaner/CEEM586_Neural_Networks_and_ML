# Neural Networks and Machine Learning
## Instructions:  
In this project, you will:  

* Examine what common architectures are and activation functions for neural networks  
* Examine how to optimize the parameters in a neural network  
* Make predictions using neural networks in R  
* Practice Deep Learning using R  
* Apply ideas for cross-validation for neural network model development and validation  
* Tune parameters in a neural network using a grid search  
* Use the package Lime in R to recognize which variables are driving the recommendations your neural
network is making  

## Part One - Projecting Data for Neural Networks    

In this part of the project, you will project data for neural networks using the file **ElectionData.csv**, which contains the fraction of votes by county earned by President Trump and Secretary Clinton in the 2016 US Presidential election, sorted by county FIPS code (FIPS stands for **F**ederal **I**nformation **P**rocessing **S**ystem, and is a geographic identifier). The data file also includes several variables that may be useful to predict these fractions. Use the data to develop a neural network model for either individual.

This part of the project requires some work in RStudio, located on the project page in Canvas. Use that space, along with the provided script and data file, to perform the work, then use this document to answer questions on what you discover.

1. How well did your model predict the election results?  


2. Do you think your model will generalize well to new data? Why or why not?  

3. What could you do to improve the model?  

4. In the space below, describe your neural network structure (i.e., how many hidden layers were in the network?). How many nodes are in each hidden layer? Which activation function
